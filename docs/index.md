# Intelligence Briefs

Evidence-tiered research briefs on AI engineering, productivity, and agent architecture.

## What This Is

Each brief synthesizes academic papers, industry reports, and practitioner evidence into structured analysis with explicit confidence levels. Sources are classified by evidence tier:

- **Tier 1**: Peer-reviewed papers, pre-registered trials, standards body reports
- **Tier 2**: Major industry research (n>500), institutional reports
- **Tier 3**: Benchmark leaderboards, practitioner reports, expert analysis

## Briefs
